# cleaning Zip Codes from a text file

In this project we read from text file, pull out a few values and build an object giving a longitude and latitude that correlates with the Zip code and push it to a database.

Data from [2015 Census U.S. Gazetteer files]- https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer.html

```
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("5984eec0aca77846b51f9199"),
	"ZIPCODEGEOID" : "00647",
	"INTPTLAT" : " 17.963613",
	"INTPTLONG" : " -66.947127                                                                                                                                 "
}
```
